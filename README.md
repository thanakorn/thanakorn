## ⌗ About Me

👋 Hi, My name is Thanakorn

I'm an engineer passionate about 📱 software development, 🗃 data, and 🤖 artificial intelligence living in Bangkok, Thailand. I enjoy 💻 coding, 📚 learning, 🔨 building things(especially intelligent systems), and ✍️ sharing what I’ve learned.

### 🧑‍💻 Projects
- [DeceptiveMaze](https://github.com/thanakorn/gym-image-maze) - Reinforcement learning environment developed using OpenAI Gym inspired by [Abandoning Objectives: Evolution through the Search for Novelty Alone](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~meeden/DevelopmentalRobotics/lehman_ecj11.pdf).
- [Self-supervised Time-series Classification](https://github.com/thanakorn/self-supervised-ts-classification) - An ML project demonstrating how to classify time-series when there is no label available using [Variational Autoencoder](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/variational-autoencoders/).
- [Crop Classification](https://github.com/thanakorn/crop_classification_using_deep_learning_tutorial) - A tutorial on how to identify a crop land from Satellite images using deep learning.
- [Cloud Detection](https://github.com/thanakorn/cloud_segmentation_app) - A project that turns a deep learning model into a real application on Google Cloud Platform([more details](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/putting-machine-learning-model-into-production-with-google-cloud-platform-and-dvc-f6a22cdcf4a5)).
